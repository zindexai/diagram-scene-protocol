# Changelog

Each entry is a tag in this repository, named for the Zindex release that first served that version of the spec and schemas. Documents in every version so far carry `"schemaVersion": "0.1"`.

## v6.0.0

First public release: SPEC.md, `schemas/scene.schema.json`, `schemas/ops.schema.json` and the examples, under the Apache License 2.0.

Compared with the schemas zindex.ai served before (Zindex 5.1.1), these no longer accept:

- `transactionMode` on the operations envelope. Every edit applies whole or not at all (10.2).
- `baseRevision: 0`. Revisions are numbered from 1.
- `required` on a constraint, `rows` on a `grid` constraint and `axis` on a `centerIn` constraint. Nothing read them: a grid's rows follow from `columns`, and `centerIn` always centres on both axes. A version stored with them loses them when an edit next saves it.

These are no longer described, and are still accepted, because `layoutStrategy` accepts other keys: `layoutStrategy.algorithm`, which was required and is now optional and ignored, and `nodeWidth` and `nodeHeight`. The reference engine picks its placement method from `diagramFamily` (3.4).

Added: `textStyle` on `createNode` and `updateNode` (10.3, 10.4).
